Sidebar widget filled with random subversive words designed to create more work for your friendly national electronic surveillance agency.

== Description ==

Adds some random subversive words in a widget in your sidebar that's designed to create more work for our friends in illegal government domestic surveillance.

This plugin is inspired by the old M-X spook program that comes with Emacs.

Code is flagrantly borrowed from the original Hello Dolly plugin.  I also borrowed a spook.lines file from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/spook/ because it had a huge number of subversive words in it.

== Installation ==

1. Put the mpspook.php file in your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
1. Activate the plugin in the Plugins menu in Wordpress's admin page.
1. Go to Appearance, go to Widgets, you'll see Meta-Press Spook in your widgets list.  Add it to your sidebar and enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Won't this get me in trouble with three-letter agencies? =

Maybe.  They're not telling.

= Isn't the NSA smart enough to filter out Meta-Press Spook's keyword spamming with their data-mining systems? =

Probably.  But they're not telling.  Just smile and wave at the nice NSA agent!
